# lstms_for_predictive_maintenance_in_R
This project shows how a keras lstm neural network can be implemented in R, in the R notebook the phyton code is next to the
R code. The original python code is https://github.com/Azure/lstms_for_predictive_maintenance/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Basics%20for%20Predictive%20Maintenance.ipynb 

## Learned lessons
- it seems easier to scale the data using python's preprocessing.MinMaxScaler
- the data generator of python is handy, could not find something similar for R, let me know if there is something
- data wrangling seems to be easier with R, but maybe that opinion is due to my limited knowledge of python
